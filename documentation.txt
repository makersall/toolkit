Layouts:
content: for basic pages of content in the toolkit. Can optionally include an image
summary: for pages that summarize/outline an argument, strategy, etc., primarily using small amounts of text plus lots of links


If you need to do a link in the middle of a page:

- If it's to a simple header, such as a pound sign, where the text of the header doesn't contain any punctuation or anything else that might throw off the markdown parser, just take the words in the header, make them lowercase, and put hyphens between them
- if it's not a simple header, this approach works pretty well: 
```
<h2 id="opportunity">The Opportunity:  The Explosion of Emerging Tech</h2>
```

display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 80px 200px auto 40px;

.container { grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr; }

grid-template-columns: minmax(100px, 1fr) 2fr;
grid-column-gap

Home page:
different layout depending on if it�s a smart phone or iPad/PC
Why: I�m making a case

Strategy & other summary pages:
Grid, like Vox, the guardian
2 columns� text is 3 short lines
Maybe:
Article
Image
Header
Content

Articles:
pix
text


On dealing w ie, 2018:
The most common use case for using IE�s implicit grid is using it to generate your rows for you. If you want all the rows in the grid to have their height dictated by the height of their content, you do not need to bother defining -ms-grid-rows (the IE version of grid-template-rows). The rows will automatically be generated for you in IE when placing your grid cells.

For summary pages, I decided not to try to auto generate them using front matter. I'm nervous about having code where if it breaks,
all of the links that move you around site would stop working. It's and I think I'm going to want organically grow
how the summary pages work, so I don't want to lock myself in. But if I do want to go back to trying it, here's the test code:

chapters:
  - name: Create a Culture of Community-Oriented Coding UX
    link: '10-culture-community-coding-UX.html'
    image: 'painted-hands-1332840-pxh.jpg'
  - name: Create a Continuum of Skill
    link: '20-continuum-skill.html'
    image: 'paint-brushes-1366198-pxh.jpg'

{% for chapter in page.chapters %}
<article><img src="{{'/assets/images/' | append:  chapter.image | relative_url }}"  style= "width: 200px; height: auto;">
<a href="{{ chapter.link }}">{{chapter.name}}</a>
</article>
{%- endfor -%}
