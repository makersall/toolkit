title: Smooth the Learning Curve
# image:
---
Most efforts at democratizing emerging tech focus on training people to use the tech as it is.  But learning to code is too hard for us to train enough people to make a big difference. We need to do for emerging tech coding what Extension Services did for agriculture tech: make it much easier for everyday adults to learn.

We already have the techniques to do it: user experience design (UX).  In the worlds of web and mobile, UX has had a profound impact on how designers work.  But when it comes the coding languages and frameworks that are used to build those websites and apps? Not so much.

If we're going to democratize emerging tech, we need to use UX in a community-oriented way to smooth the learning curve for programming.

[Intro](05-why-how-smooth-curve.html)
What is the problem we need to solve?
Expand coding beyond people who already find it easy to learn (self-selection bias)
What is UX and how you do it?

[Create A Culture Of Community-Oriented Coding UX](10-culture-community-coding-UX.html)
Help tech companies and community groups work together to improve coding UX 
Create coding UX expertise in the community that can lead to jobs or small businesses

[Create a Continuum of Skill](20-continuum-skill.html)
Create a continuum from power users to "blue-collar coders" to skilled developers, and smooth that learning curve
Transform people from tool users to tool makers -- and remember that "Hip-Hop Wasn't Created by Sound Engineers"

[Evangelize Breakthrough Research](30-evangelize-research.html) on Coding UX
Get coding UX research into the hands of coders who are creating &amp; maintaining programming languages and frameworks

Create [Institutional Support](40-institutional-support) For Coding UX
To make coding UX sustainable, get Big Tech companies, VC, universities, and foundations to support it
