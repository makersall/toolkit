## [The Threat and the Opportunity](pages/10-intro/10-threat-opportunity.html)
Will robots/AI [destroy millions of jobs]()? Will they [create massive inequality]()? These threats are real, but we've focused so much on them that we've overlooked a once-in-a-century opportunity.

In the next 20 years, not only robots and AI but augmented/virtual reality, digital fabrication, and other emerging tech will create an abundance of wealth. If we can train millions of adults from Compton to Appalachia to become developers and designers, they can capture a big enough slice of emerging tech's wealth to help [revitalize all our communities]() -- regardless of robots/AI's impact.

## [The Model](pages/10-intro/30-extension-citizenship-schools.html)
If we're going to succeed, we need to [stop thinking small](). 

We aren't the first to face a training challenge this daunting; we already did it, [in agriculture](). If we remix [Extension Services](pages/10-intro/30-extension-citizenship-schools.html) and [Citizenship Schools](pages/10-intro/30-extension-citizenship-schools.html#Citizenship-Schools), we can pull this off.

How do we do it? With [3 strategies](pages/strategies.html):

1. [Smooth the Learning Curve](pages/30-smooth/00-index.html)
2. Create a [Community-Based Ecosystem of Support](pages/50-support/00-index.html)
3. Combine Tech &amp; [Civic Engagement Training](pages/70-civic/00-index.html)

How do we make this happen? Here's how [you can get started](pages/90-organize/00-index.html).

<!-- Extension Services radically transforming the way millions of US farmers practiced farming by:

  - Made modern farming techniques much easier to learn 
- Fostered a rich community-based web of support
- Operated on a massive scale
- Provided real accountability

- __Made Modern Farming Techniques Much Easier to Learn__by breaking down complex agricultural research and designing farming techniques so they could be easily understood by everyday farmers -- and by creating feedback loops between researchers and community networks of farmers
- __Fostered A Rich Community-Based Web Of Support__, including clubs, local farmer demonstrations, and other forms of peer-to-peer learning
- __Operated On A Massive Scale__, embedding extension agents in every agricultural county to organize large numbers of volunteers and identified develop local leadership
- __Provided Real Accountability__ by focusing on states and counties and demonstrating whether extension agents were transforming farming in their designated community  -->
