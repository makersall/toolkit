# The Makers All Toolkit  [Draft]
### Helping Communities Shape Their Destinies By Transforming Emerging Tech

## [The Threat](pages/intro/10-threat-opportunity.html)
Will robots/AI destroy millions of jobs? 

## [The Opportunity](pages/intro/10-threat-opportunity.html)
In the next 20 years, emerging tech -- robots/AI, augmented/virtual reality, digital fabrication, etc.  -- will create an abundance of wealth. If we can:
- Train millions of adults from Compton to Appalachia to become developers and designers
- Help their communities develop the power to shape emerging tech

They can capture a big enough slice of emerging tech's wealth to help revitalize all our communities -- regardless of robots/AI's impact.

### [The Model]()
Stop thinking small, learn from the past by remixing [Extension Services]() and [Citizenship Schools]()

This toolkit is based on Makers All's flagship report. It started out as a more web-friendly version of the report. Over time, it will evolve as communities and the tech world react to and try out its proposals.



[NOTE: obviously, the opening session is way too long. How do I take advantage of hypertext to knock it down?]
